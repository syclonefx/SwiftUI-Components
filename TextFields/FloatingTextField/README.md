## FloatingTextField
Custom SwiftUI TextField where place holder pops out of the text field and site about the textfield whe text is entered in to the textfield. This textfield also supports multiple lines of text.

**This is still a work in progress. There are a few things I need to fix.**

#### Issues
- text in textfield jumps around when view is initially displayed.
- need to remove the hardcoded offsets in the getSize modifier of the  FloatingTextFile and have them change based on size of the screen.

**If you have any ideas on how to fix any of these issues, please fork this repo and correct them and submit a pull request. Any help will be welcome.**
