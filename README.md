## SwiftUI Components
A collection of various views and components I made with SwiftUI. I thought these might be useful to others so I'm posting them for anyone to use. 

### Avatars

### HealthKit
- [Biomarker](/HealthKit/Biomarker/) Custom view for a Healthkit project that uses SwiftUI Gauge to show the progress of tracking the number of reading needed for the day.

### Pickers
